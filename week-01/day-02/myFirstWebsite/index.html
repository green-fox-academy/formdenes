            <h2>Ready to learn</h2>
            <p>I've studied mechanical engineering at BME, so I'm an engineer at heart. But in the recent times I've got interested in many things, so I decided to really learn something, not just scratch the surface.</p>
            <p>I was good with computers (I'm the family's pocket IT guy), and I discovered, that I like programming despite my older belief so currently I'm looking into that..
