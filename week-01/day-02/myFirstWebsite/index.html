        <h2>Ready to learn</h2>
        <p>I've studied mechanical engineering at BME, so I'm an engineer at heart. But in the recent times I've got
            interested in many things, so I decided to really learn something, not just scratch the surface.</p>
        <p>I was good with computers (I'm the family's pocket IT guy), and I discovered, that I like programming
            despite my older belief so currently I'm looking into that..

        <h2>RAM</h2>
        <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the
            general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same
            amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
        <h2>Programming Languauge</h2>
        <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
            They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement
            specific algorithms.</p>
        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
            Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the
